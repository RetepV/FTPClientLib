# FTPClientLib
An FTP client library written in Swift, using strict Swift Concurrency.

Please note that this is a work in progress. This project serves as a test project for me, for learning about Swift Concurrency. I do not pretend that it is currently fit for anything other than that. However, it does do FTP, and is gradually growing, so one day it might be something.

If you use this code, you are on your own. However, I do release it under GNU License V3, and you should realize that I have the copyrights. Use it for your own good, but I do not want to see it used in any commercial program without my consent. If you want to use it for your commercial program, please ask me. I will then turn it into a real and serious project, and bring it up to professional, commercial levels. We can talk about compensation later.
